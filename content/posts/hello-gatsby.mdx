title: Hello, Gatsby!

I've been excited about Gatsby for a long time!

The Static Server Generation is very appealing for a lot of websites - a blog like this is just the tip of the icerberg. Any website that is content based can benefit from a SSG website, like your portfolio or an ecommerce store. Static generated content is a lot faster to load and has extra points on the major search engines, helping your website grow up in the search rankings.

However, as a very busy freelancer, it's always been difficult for me to get more acquainted with Gatsby because my previous experiences have been totally disastrous. I used another Gatsby starter for my old website but it came with a lot of inline CSS that I didn't enjoy, and some typography helpers that I couldn't understand and wasn't interested at all. I've done several attempts on customizing it, but failed at them all. Using [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) looked fine on the development environment but my styles were gone after building. Installing either [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/) or [Braid](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/) couldn't get me a successful develop build without going through a lot of error messages and trial and error - even though I can use these design systems without problems in a fresh React app.

But I still believe in Gatsby and really want to keep going. I just can't afford to spend time in debugging and configuration at this time.

## I just want to write a blog!

I've spent lots of time on adding bells and whistles to my blog, but it lacks the most important part: content. What's the point of spending countless hours on a fancy website if I don't even write anything at it?

In (not too distant) the future, I do surely want to dive deeper into Gatsby documentation, very carefully, and understand all its ins and outs - but not now.

I just believe that Gatsby is the perfect platform for my blog and I start to start writing! How can I do that?

Well, I eventually figured out and I'm gonna share the secret formula below:

Skip Gatsby's Quick Start if you don't want to venture with configuration at this time. Go straight to [Getting Started with Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/getting-started/) and run this command line:

```
npx gatsby new my-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme
```

The command above will create a new folder called `my-blog` (feel free to replace it with your blog's name) with all dependencies installed and all complexity abstracted away. Your folder structure should look similar to this:

![The folder structure you get with this Gatsby starter abstract all complexity away](../assets/hello-gatsby-folder-structure.jpg)

Now you will want to start modifying these files:

- gatsby-config.js: Fill the `siteMetadata` section with your blog's title, your name, a description about your blog, and the links to your social networks that will be displayed at the bottom
- content/assets/avatar.png: Replace it with your desired avatar, you can use JPG images as well
- src/gatsby-theme-blog/components/bio-content.js: Write your bio in place of the placeholder content.

You can optionally modify this file as well:

- src/gatsby-theme-blog/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/colors.js: Change the accent colors used in your blog's title and links

And here's what's an example blog post look like:

![The starter blog has light and dark themes and is very nice for starting a blogging journey](../assets/hello-gatsby-sample-post.jpg)

Yay, you even get a theme switch between light and dark modes out of the box! Amazing!

Last but not least, delete the sample files from the `content/posts/` folder and create a new file called `hello-gatsby.mdx` to write your first post. Start the file by adding the post title and date with Markdown:

```
---
title: Hello, Gatsby!
date: 2020-04-22
---

I've been excited about Gatsby for a long time!
```

You can read more about the Markdown syntax [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

I recommend checking out [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting your blog. It's very simple to get started, which is our #1 goal in this post!

Now, let your imagination flow and start writing!

## What's next?

Eventually you may want to customize your blog's layout. The starter theme used in this post is intended to get the simplest possible headstart, and given this simplicity, the layout is not customizable. I know that I will soon reach this point and want to customize my website, and then that's when we will have to start diving deeper into Gatsby. For now, just having a space to write is exactly what I want, and I think that having this starter to unblock people willing to write is amazing!

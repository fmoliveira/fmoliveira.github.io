- Install Prettier & Git Lens
- Use an icon set to identify file types more easily
- Use individual workspaces per project to save your current state when switching context
- Hide node_modules folder from sidebar
- Learn keyboard shortcuts, many of them!
- Install Sync Settings extension
- Move sidebar to the right, it helps distracting you less when you toggle it because your editors will move less or none at all
- Enable autosave on focus change (I only wish I could do a combination of focus change and delay)
- Enable Emmet for JSX
  - Go to settings, search for Emmet, click on Include Languages -> Edit in settings.json and add the following markup:
  - `"emmet.includeLanguages": { "javascript": "javascriptreact" }`

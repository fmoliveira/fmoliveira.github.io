My personal website is being fully developed with Gulp and Markdown.

Sure, there're dozens of static website generators out there. What keeps you from using them? Reading dozens of static docpages before using, is it? Yeah, me too.

I'm willing to build a very simple static website generator, but this is still a proof of concept.

Work is currently in progress at slow pace. :smiley:

What does learning in public means to you?

Shawn Wang, mostly known as @swyx, posted a big tweet about it in mid-2018. Big not only in terms of size but also of great quality!

The post begins straight to the point:

> “You already know that you will never be done learning. But most people "learn in private", and lurk. They consume content without creating any themselves. Again, that's fine, but we're here to talk about being in the top quintile.” - @swyx

Shawn is talking about excellence. If you want to grow in your career, you MUST get out of your comfort zone.

This is such a huge facepalm for me!

I'm very very open to constructive feedback. I want to be a better person and a better professional, I really want to grow. You may ask: who doesn't? I know a lot of people who simply don't care! But I do care so much!

I'm always questioning myself how can I improve in several areas of my life.

But still, I always used to be a private learner. I never realised how much impact this could have in my life and career.

Learning in public means sharing with the public what you're learning - and the public may include but is not limited to: your family, your friends, your colleagues, local or online communities on Twitter/Reddit/Slack Groups/whatever.

You don't need to pick up a lot of channels, only one or two is excellent. The golden rule is finding at least one community that inspires and encourages you. Twitter and Reddit are great tools for this.

When you share your studies with someone, you start to be held accountable. Your peers will ask you how is it going with a technology you were studying or a side project that you were working on. You've just entered a new circle.

Naturally, we'll feel a little bit of pressure to keep studying or keep working in a side project. Well managed, this pressure is a lot beneficial because it will keep pushing you forward.

> LEARNING IN PUBLIC WILL KEEP PUSHING YOU FORWARD.

I used to be a public learner for several short bursts but always ended up vanishing in a sudden.

It's very important that we discipline ourselves - look, I'm included on this! I know it's not easy - but this is a reminder of something we have to do in order to achieve excellence!

Don't study a lot of things at the same time. Don't work in a lot of projects at the same time.

Focus on one technology at a time - it's fine to hit small milestones and switch to another technology that feels more interesting for the moment. But don't let the hype train frustrate you.

Keep your momentum. Keep sharing what you're learning. Keep learning in public.

> HOW TO START LEARNING IN PUBLIC?

It's very simple. What do you want to study next? Create a post either on Twitter or Reddit and tell people what you're starting to study. Ask for tips and directions. Add some niche hashtags or post in a proper subreddit. Mention your colleagues, ask for shares and retweets for reach.

And start working on it!

People may get back to you with tips and directions, but don't feel bad if they don't. Just call it “your learning journal” in this case, but it's open for everyone to comment and help you with feedback.

Share your progress OFTEN! The length of often may vary for you, but pick something that is realistic and also not very comfortable. If you get comfortable with it, you may end up quitting!

> CHALLENGE YOURSELF!

Do your best and keep it consistent. It's better to study 45 minutes every day than blocking Saturday's afternoon for it. If you miss one Saturday, it means your whole week-worth of study went wrong. And it's scientifically proven to be easier to make it a habit if you study a little bit every day.

The summary is:

- Make a public post about something you are starting to study
- Call out for people and hashtags that may be able to help you out
- Share what you've learned
- Share what you've struggled with
- Tell how you overcame your challenges and always ask questions if you're stuck
- Rinse and repeat

I invite you to join this challenge with me today and start learning in public. Shall we?
